Coinco - Crypto Platform (HTML/CSS/JS)

Coinco is a responsive front-end platform built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that simulates a login/signup interface for a cryptocurrency-themed site, complete with user session handling via `localStorage`. Once signed in, users are greeted with a dashboard-style homepage featuring events, team highlights, and product features.



 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Fully responsive UI with modern glassmorphism styling
- 🔐 Sign In / Sign Up forms with validation
- 🧠 Simulated user management with `localStorage`
- ✨ Dynamic homepage shown after successful login
- 🎨 CSS-only animations and effects
- 📱 Mobile responsive navigation and layout



📁 Project Structure

This project is a single HTML file (`index.html`) containing all:

- HTML Markup
- CSS (embedded in `<style>`)
- JavaScript logic (in `<script>` at the end of body)

There are no external files except for:
- Google Fonts (Poppins)
- Font Awesome (CDN)
- A remote image from Unsplash (for the homepage)



🛠️ How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in a browser
   Just double-click `index.html` or open it with any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

2. Create an account
   Use the Sign Up form to register (fields include email, username, and password).

3. Log in
   Once signed up, go to Sign In, enter your credentials, and click Sign In.

4. Explore homepage
   After login, you'll see the homepage with hero section, features, and team info.

5. Logout
   Click the Logout button in the navbar to end the session and return to login.



⚙️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (modern layout & gradient backgrounds)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- `localStorage` for user simulation

✅ Notes

- Passwords are stored in `localStorage` as plain text for demo purposes. In production, this must **never** be done.
- There is **no backend**; this project is meant for front-end demonstration or mockups.
- You can reset the user data by clearing browser local storage (`localStorage.clear()` in DevTools).



🧪 Demo Use Cases

- Portfolio project showcasing front-end skills
- Prototype for a crypto or finance dashboard UI
